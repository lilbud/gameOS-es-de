Theme 'Game OS' - 2024-07-07 by Lilbud

Port of the Pegasus Frontend theme of the same name, originally by PlayingKarrde

Pretty much just a recreation of that theme in ES-DE. Pegasus is a frontend that was created sometime in 2019 as a much more fully-featured alternative to EmulationStation. I haven't kept up on development but I believe it is still going. 

Pegasus is much more advanced than ES, enabling much more control over theme creation. The themes are based in QT5, which I didn't have the time to wrap my head around.

Because of these differences, the ES-DE version would be much more limited.

Most of that original theme made it over to ES-DE pretty 1:1. The "default" layout is based on what I believe to be the game info view. The grid options are much the same, but just the logos instead of background screenshots/videos. Also Pegasus has a home screen -> system gamelist -> game view layout, where ES is only system -> gamelist. I only mention this to explain some of the design choices I made.

Multiple colorSchemes included, plus an adjustable grid layout (3-8 Columns)
